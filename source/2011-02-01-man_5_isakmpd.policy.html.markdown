NAME
     isakmpd.policy - policy configuration file for isakmpd

DESCRIPTION
     isakmpd.policy is the policy configuration file for the isakmpd(8)
     daemon, managing security association and key management for the ipsec(4)
     layer of the kernel's networking stack.  The isakmpd(8) daemon, also
     known as the IKEv1 key management daemon, implements the Internet Key
     Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) protocol.  It follows then that references to
     IKE in this document pertain to IKEv1 only, and not IKEv2.

     isakmpd(8) is used when two systems need to automatically set up a pair
     of Security Associations (SAs) for secure communication using IPsec.
     IKEv1 operates in two stages:

     In the first stage (Main or Identity Protection Mode), the two IKE
     daemons establish a secure link between themselves, fully authenticating
     each other and establishing key material for encrypting/authenticating
     future communications between them.  This step is typically only
     performed once for every pair of IKE daemons.

     In the second stage (also called Quick Mode), the two IKE daemons create
     the pair of SAs for the parties that wish to communicate using IPsec.
     These parties may be the hosts the IKE daemons run on, a host and a
     network behind a firewall, or two networks behind their respective
     firewalls.  At this stage, the exact parameters of the SAs (e.g.,
     algorithms to use, encapsulation mode, lifetime) and the identities of
     the communicating parties (hosts, networks, etc.) are specified.  The
     reason for the existence of Quick Mode is to allow for fast SA setup,
     once the more heavy-weight Main Mode has been completed.  Generally,
     Quick Mode uses the key material derived from Main Mode to provide keys
     to the IPsec transforms to be used.

     Alternatively, a new Diffie-Hellman computation may be performed, which
     significantly slows down the exchange, but at the same time provides
     Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).  Briefly, this means that even should an
     attacker manage to break long-term keys used in other sessions (or,
     specifically, if an attacker breaks the Diffie-Hellman exchange performed
     during Main Mode), they will not be able to decrypt this traffic.
     Normally, no PFS is provided (the key material used by the IPsec SAs
     established as a result of this exchange will be derived from the key
     material of the Main Mode exchange), allowing for a faster Quick Mode
     exchange (no public key computations).

     IKE proposals are "suggestions" by the initiator of an exchange to the
     responder as to what protocols and attributes should be used on a class
     of packets.  For example, a given exchange may ask for ESP with 3DES and
     MD5 and AH with SHA1 (applied successively on the same packet), or just
     ESP with Blowfish and RIPEMD-160.  The responder examines the proposals
     and determines which of them are acceptable, according to policy and any
     credentials.

     The following paragraphs assume some knowledge of the contents of the
     keynote(4) and keynote(5) man pages.

     In the KeyNote policy model for IPsec, no distinction is currently made
     based on the ordering of AH and ESP in the packet.  Should this change in
     the future, an appropriate attribute (see below) will be added.

     The goal of security policy for IKE is thus to determine, based on local
     policy (provided in the isakmpd.policy file), credentials provided during
     the IKE exchanges (or obtained through other means), the SA attributes
     proposed during the exchange, and perhaps other (side-channel)
     information, whether a pair of SAs should be installed in the system (in
     fact, whether both the IPsec SAs and the flows should be installed).  For
     each proposal suggested by or to the remote IKE daemon, the KeyNote
     system is consulted as to whether the proposal is acceptable based on
     local policy (contained in isakmpd.policy, in the form of policy
     assertions) and remote credentials (e.g., KeyNote credentials or X509
     certificates provided by the remote IKE daemon).

     isakmpd.policy is simply a flat ascii(7) file containing KeyNote policy
     assertions, separated by blank lines (note that KeyNote assertions may
     not contain blank lines).  isakmpd.policy is read when isakmpd(8) is
     first started, and every time it receives a SIGHUP signal.  The new
     policies read will be used for all new Phase 2 (IPsec) SAs established
     from that point on (even if the associated Phase 1 SA was already
     established when the new policies were loaded).  The policy change will
     not affect already established Phase 2 SAs.

     For more details on KeyNote assertion format, please see keynote(5).
     Briefly, KeyNote policy assertions used in IKE have the following
     characteristics:

     o   The Authorizer field is typically "POLICY" (but see the examples
         below, for use of policy delegation).

     o   The Licensees field can be an expression of passphrases used for
         authentication of the Main Mode exchanges, and/or public keys
         (typically, X509 certificates), and/or X509 distinguished names.

     o   The Conditions field contains an expression of attributes from the
         IPsec policy action set (see below as well as the keynote syntax man
         page for more details).

     o   The ordered return-values set for IPsec policy is "false, true".

     For an explanation of these fields and their semantics, see keynote(5).

     For example, the following policy assertion:

         Authorizer: "POLICY"
         Licensees: "passphrase:foobar" || "x509-base64:abcd```" ||
           "passphrase-md5-hex:3858f62230ac3c915f300c664312c63f" ||
           "passphrase-sha1-hex:8843d7f92416211de9ebb963ff4ce28125932878"
         Conditions: app_domain ``` "IPsec policy" && esp_present ``` "yes"
                     && esp_enc_alg != "null" -> "true";

     says that any proposal from a remote host that authenticates using the
     passphrase "foobar" or the public key contained in the X509 certificate
     encoded as "abcd```" will be accepted, as long as it contains ESP with a
     non-null algorithm (i.e., the packet will be encrypted).  The last two
     authorizers are the MD5 and SHA1 hashes respectively of the passphrase
     "foobar".  This form may be used instead of the "passphrase:..." one to
     protect the passphrase as included in the policy file (or as distributed
     in a signed credential).

     The following policy assertion:

         Authorizer: "POLICY"
         Licensees: "DN:/CN=CA Certificate"
         Conditions: app_domain ``` "IPsec policy" && esp_present ``` "yes"
                     && esp_enc_alg != "null" -> "true";

     is similar to the previous one, but instead of including a complete X509
     credential in the Licensees field, only the X509 certificate's Subject
     Canonical Name needs to be specified (note that the "DN:" prefix is
     necessary).

     KeyNote credentials have the same format as policy assertions, with one
     difference: the Authorizer field always contains a public key, and the
     assertion is signed (and thus its integrity can be cryptographically
     verified).  Credentials are used to build chains of delegation of
     authority.  They can be exchanged during an IKE exchange, or can be
     retrieved through some out-of-band mechanism (no such mechanism is
     currently supported in this implementation however).  See isakmpd.conf(5)
     on how to specify what credentials to send in an IKE exchange.

     Passphrases that appear in the Licensees field are encoded as the string
     "passphrase:", followed by the passphrase itself (case-sensitive).
     Alternatively (and preferably), they may be encoded using the
     "passphrase-md5-hex:" or "passphrase-sha1-hex:" prefixes, followed by the
     md5(1) or sha1(1) hash of the passphrase itself, encoded as a hexadecimal
     string (using lower-case letters only).

     When X509-based authentication is performed in Main Mode, any X509
     certificates received from the remote IKE daemon are converted to very
     simple KeyNote credentials.  The conversion is straightforward: the
     issuer of the X509 certificate becomes the Authorizer of the KeyNote
     credential, the subject becomes the only Licensees entry, while the
     Conditions field simply asserts that the credential is only valid for
     "IPsec policy" use (see the app_domain action attribute below).

     Similarly, any X509 CA certificates present in the directory pointed to
     by the appropriate isakmpd.conf(5) entry are converted to such pseudo-
     credentials.  This allows one to write KeyNote policies that delegate
     specific authority to CAs (and the keys those CAs certify, recursively).

     For more details on KeyNote assertion format, see keynote(5).

     Information about the proposals, the identity of the remote IKE daemon,
     the packet classes to be protected, etc. are encoded in what is called an
     action set.  The action set is composed of name-value attributes, similar
     in some ways to shell environment variables.  These values are
     initialized by isakmpd(8) before each query to the KeyNote system, and
     can be tested against in the Conditions field of assertions.  See
     keynote(4) and keynote(5) for more details on the format and semantics of
     the Conditions field.

     Note that assertions and credentials can make references to non-existent
     attributes without catastrophic failures (access may be denied, depending
     on the overall structure, but will not be accidentally granted).  One
     reason for credentials referencing non-existent attributes is that they
     were defined within a specific implementation or network only.

     In the following attribute set, IPv4 addresses are encoded as ASCII
     strings in the usual dotted-quad format.  However, all quads are three
     digits long.  For example, the IPv4 address 10.128.1.12 would be encoded
     as 010.128.001.012.  Similarly, IPv6 addresses are encoded in the
     standard x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x format, where the 'x's are the hexadecimal
     values of the eight 16-bit pieces of the address.  All 'x's are four
     digits long.  For example, the address 1080:0:12:0:8:800:200C:417A would
     be encoded as 1080:0000:0012:0000:0008:0800:200C:417A.

     The following attributes are currently defined:

     ah_auth_alg

             to a value other than zero, they should have the same value (in
             valid IKE proposals).  Valid values are 1 (768-bit MODP), 2
             (1024-bit MODP), 3 (155-bit EC), 4 (185-bit EC), and 5 (1536-bit
